1.  Introduction

   To correlate network data among different Network Telemetry planes as
   described in Section 3.1 of [RFC9232] or among different YANG-Push
   subscription types defined in Section 3.1 of [RFC8641], network
   observation timestamping describes when the state change was observed
   or from when to when the data was accounted.  This is essential for
   understanding the timely relationship among these different planes
   and YANG push subscription types.

   With [I-D.tgraf-netconf-notif-sequencing] the delay between the YANG
   Notification export and the arrival at the downstream system storing
   the data can be measured.  With network observation timestamping
   described in this document, the delay between the network observation
   and the data export of the YANG push publisher process can be
   measured as well, extending the delay measurement scope from the time
   the network observation and storing the data.

Internet-Draft     YANG Notifications Observation Time         June 2024


   When the time bucket length in a time series database and the
   periodical YANG push subscription time is identical, the eventTime of
   the netconf notification message header is used for indexing, there
   is variable delay between the observation time and the eventTime, and
   the anchor-time as described in Section 4.2 of [RFC8641] is close to
   the time bucket boundaries, a time bucket is going to have
   periodically 0 or 2 measurements indexed instead of 1.  Leading to
   inconsistent accounting errors in the time series database.  This
   problem is resolved by using the observation-time instead of the
   eventTime for time series database indexing.

   By extending the YANG-Push Notification header with the YANG objects
   observation-time and point-in-time for streaming update notifications
   it is ensured that the "observation-time" timestamp is always present
   with the best available time, can be therefore used unconditionally
   in the data processing chain and with point-in-time there is semantic
   describing the when it was observed in time.

2.  Terminologies

   The following terms are defined in [RFC8639] and are not redefined
   here:

   Publisher

   Receiver

   Subscription

   In addition, this document defines the following terms:

   Observation-time: Describes when the metrics were observed in YANG-
   Push subscriptions.

   point-in-time: Describes at which point in time the metrics were
   observed in YANG-Push subscriptions.

3.  Extend the Streaming Update Notifications

   Besides the Subscription ID as described in Section 3.7 of [RFC8641],
   the following network observation time metadata objects are part of
   "push-update" and "push-change-update" notifications.

   observation-time:  Describes the measurement observation time for the
      "push-update" notification in a "periodical" and for the "push-
      change-update" notification in a "on-change" subscription.  By
      comparing the "observation-time" of two "push-update"
      notifications in a periodical subscription, the collector can

Internet-Draft     YANG Notifications Observation Time         June 2024


      deduce the actual cadence of the measurements, and compare it with
      the subscription configuration.  In case of an "on-change"
      subscription it describes the time when the network state change
      was observed.

   point-in-time:  Describes at which point in time the value of
      observation-time was observed.  For "periodical" subscription, the
      "current-accounting" describes the point in time where the metrics
      were polled and observed.  For "on-change" subsriptions, the value
      of point-in-time is either "state-changed", when the state change
      was observed in real-time with or without sync on start option.
      Or it is "current-state" when it was observed after the YANG-Push
      subscription was established and the time since the state changed
      to current state is unkown.

   Figure 1 provides an example timeline of events to describe "point-
   in-time".  At "T2", if the network node was capable to store the
   initial state change observation timestamp from "T1" prior to the
   YANG-Push subscription establishment at "T2", the observation-
   timestamp of "T1" is used and "point-in-time" is set to "state-
   changed".  If the network node is not capable to store the timestamp
   prior to the YANG-Push subscription establishment at "T2", the
   observation-timestamp of "T2" is used and "point-in-time" is set to
   "current-state".  Depending of capability and implementation of
   "periodical" YANG-Push subscription, either the "observation-
   timestamp" of "T3" with "point-in-time" is set to "accounting-start"
   or "observation-timestamp" of "T4" with "point-in-time" is set to
   "accounting-end".

4.  YANG-Push capabilities

   YANG-related system capabilites can be discovered by subscribing to
   the datastore defined in [RFC9196].  This document augments the
   "ietf-notification-capabilities" defined in Section 5 of [RFC9196] so
   that the YANG-Push receiver can learn the capabilities defined in
   this documents throught the datastore.

   The definition of this YANG augmentation is specified in Section 5.

5.  The "ietf-yp-observation-time" YANG Module

   This YANG module augments the "ietf-yang-push" module with the
   observation-time and point-in-time in the "push-update" and "push-
   change-update" streaming update notifications.

6.  Implementation Status

   Note to the RFC-Editor: Please remove this section before publishing.

6.1.  6WIND VSR

   6WIND implemented this document for a YANG Push publisher on
   UDP-based Transport for Configured Subscriptions
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-udp-notif] in their VSR platform.

7.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations for the YANG notifications subscription
   mechanism are described in [RFC8641].  This document adds no
   additional security considerations.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document describes the URI used for the IETF XML Registry and
   registers a new YANG module name.

8.1.  URI

   IANA is requested to add this document as a reference in the
   following URI in the IETF XML Registry [RFC3688].

   URI:  urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-yp-observation-time

   Registrant Contact:  The IESG.

   XML:  N/A; the requested URI is an XML namespace.

   Reference:  RFC5277; RFC-to-be

8.2.  YANG module name

   This document registers the following YANG module in the YANG Module
   Names Registry [RFC6020], within the "YANG Parameters" registry:

   name:  ietf-yp-observation-time

   namespace:  urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-yp-observation-time

   prefix:  ypot

   Reference:  RFC-to-be
