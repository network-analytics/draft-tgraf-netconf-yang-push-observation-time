1.  Introduction

   To correlate network data among different Network Telemetry planes as
   described in Section 3.1 of [RFC9232] or among different YANG push
   subscription types defined in Section 3.1 of [RFC8641], network
   observation timestamping describes when the state change was observed
   or from when to when the data was accounted.  This is essential for
   understanding the timely relationship among these different planes
   and YANG push subscription types.

   With [I-D.tgraf-netconf-notif-sequencing] the delay between the YANG
   Notification export and the arrival at the downstream system storing
   the data can be measured.  With network observation timestamping
   described in this document, the delay between the network observation
   and the data export of the YANG push publisher process can be
   measured as well, extending the delay measurement scope from the time
   the network observation and storing the data.

Internet-Draft     YANG Notifications Observation Time          May 2024


   When the time bucket length in a time series database and the
   periodical YANG push subscription time is identical, the eventTime of
   the netconf notification message header is used for indexing, there
   is variable delay between the observation time and the eventTime, and
   the anchor-time as described in Section 4.2 of [RFC8641] is close to
   the time bucket boundaries, a time bucket is going to have
   periodically 0 or 2 measurements indexed instead of 1.  Leading to
   inconsistent accounting errors in the time series database.  This
   problem is resolved by using the observation-time instead of the
   eventTime for time series database indexing.

   By extending the YANG-Push Notification header with the YANG objects
   observation-time and moment-in-time for streaming update
   notifications it is ensured that the "observation-time" timestamp is
   always present with the best available time, can be therefore used
   unconditionally in the data processing chain and with moment-in-time
   there is semantic describing the when it was observed in time.

2.  Terminologies

   The following terms are defined in [RFC8639] and are not redefined
   here:

   Publisher

   Receiver

   Subscription

   In addition, this document defines the following terms:

   Observation-time: Describes the measurement observation time for the
   "push-update" notification in a "periodical" subscription and the
   time when the network state change was observed.

   Moment-in-time: Describes at which point in time the metrics where
   observed.  Could be at the beginning or the end of the periodical
   subscription intervall or when the state change occured or was last
   observed with a on-change with or without sync on start option.

3.  Extend the Streaming Update Notifications

   Besides the Subscription ID as described in Section 3.7 of [RFC8641],
   the following network observation time metadata objects are part of
   "push-update" and "push-change-update" notifications.

   observation-time:  Describes the measurement observation time for the

      "push-update" notification in a "periodical" and for the "push-
      change-update" notification in a "on-change" subscription.  By
      comparing the "observation-time" of two "push-update"
      notifications in a periodical subscription, the collector can
      deduce the actual cadence of the measurements, and compare it with
      the subscription configuration.  In case of an "on-change"
      subscription it describes the time when the network state change
      was observed.

   moment-in-time:  Describes at which point in time the observation-
      time was observed.  For "periodical" subscription this is either
      at the "start" or the "end" of the accounting period.  For an "on-
      change" subscription it is with "start" the time when the network
      state change occured and was observed.

   Figure 1 provides an example of a JSON encoded, [RFC8259], "push-
   change-update" notification message over HTTPS-based
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-https-notif] or UDP-based
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-udp-notif] transport for the same subscription.

5.1.  6WIND VSR

   6WIND implemented this document for a YANG Push publisher on
   UDP-based Transport for Configured Subscriptions
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-udp-notif] in their VSR platform.

6.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations for the YANG notifications subscription
   mechanism are described in [RFC8641].  This document adds no
   additional security considerations.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document describes the URI used for the IETF XML Registry and
   registers a new YANG module name.

7.1.  URI

   IANA is requested to add this document as a reference in the
   following URI in the IETF XML Registry [RFC3688].

   URI:  urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-yang-push-netobs-timestamping

   Registrant Contact:  The IESG.

   XML:  N/A; the requested URI is an XML namespace.

   Reference:  RFC5277; RFC-to-be

7.2.  YANG module name

   This document registers the following YANG module in the YANG Module
   Names Registry [RFC6020], within the "YANG Parameters" registry:

   name:  ietf-yang-push-observation-timestamp

   namespace:
      urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-yang-push-observation-timestamp

   prefix:  ypot

   Reference:  RFC-to-be

8.  Operational Considerations

8.1.  On Change Sync On Start

   For "on-change sync on start" subscriptions, if the timestamp for the
   network state change was observed before the subscription was
   established and is not recorded in the YANG datastore, then the
   observation-time should record the last known time and the moment-in-
   time should be set to "end".

9.  Acknowledgements

   The authors would like to thank Rob Wilton, Nick Corran, Pierre
   Francois Ahmed Elhassany and Jean Quilbeuf for their review and
   valuable comments.
