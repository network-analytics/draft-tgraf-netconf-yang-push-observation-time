    <abstract>
      <t>This document extends the YANG-Push Notification header with the YANG
      objects observation timestamp and timestamp type for streaming update
      notifications.</t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

    <section anchor="Introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>To correlate network data among different Network Telemetry planes as
      described in Section 3.1 of <xref target="RFC9232"/> or among different
      YANG push subscription types defined in Section 3.1 of <xref
      target="RFC8641"/>, network observation timestamping describes when the
      state change was observed or from when to when the data was accounted.
      This is essential for understanding the timely relationship among these
      different planes and YANG push subscription types.</t>

      <t>With <xref target="I-D.tgraf-netconf-notif-sequencing"/> the delay
      between the YANG Notification export and the arrival at the downstream
      system storing the data can be measured. With network observation
      timestamping described in this document, the delay between the network
      observation and the data export of the YANG push publisher process can
      be measured as well, extending the delay measurement scope from the time
      the network observation and storing the data.</t>

      <t>When the time bucket length in a time series database and the
      periodical YANG push subscription time is identical, the eventTime of
      the netconf notification message header is used for indexing, there is
      variable delay between the observation time and the eventTime, and the
      anchor-time as described in Section 4.2 of <xref target="RFC8641"/> is
      close to the time bucket boundaries, a time bucket is going to have
      periodically 0 or 2 measurements indexed instead of 1. Leading to
      inconsistent accounting errors in the time series database. This problem
      is resolved by using the observation-time instead of the eventTime for
      time series database indexing.</t>

      <t>By extending the YANG-Push Notification header with the YANG objects
      observation-time and point-in-time for streaming update notifications it
      is ensured that the "observation-time" timestamp is always present with
      the best available time, can be therefore used unconditionally in the
      data processing chain and with point-in-time there is semantic
      describing the when it was observed in time.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Terminologies">
      <t>The following terms are defined in <xref target="RFC8639"/> and are
      not redefined here:</t>

      <t>Publisher</t>

      <t>Receiver</t>

      <t>Subscription</t>

      <t>In addition, this document defines the following terms:</t>

      <t>Observation-time: Describes the measurement observation time for the
      "push-update" notification in a "periodical" subscription and the time
      when the network state change was observed.</t>

      <t>point-in-time: Describes at which point in time the metrics where
      observed. Could be at the beginning or the end of the periodical
      subscription intervall or when the state change occured or was last
      observed with a on-change with or without sync on start option.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Streaming-Update"
             title="Extend the Streaming Update Notifications">
      <t>Besides the Subscription ID as described in Section 3.7 of <xref
      target="RFC8641"/>, the following network observation time metadata
      objects are part of "push-update" and "push-change-update"
      notifications.</t>

      <dl>
        <dt>observation-time:</dt>

        <dd>Describes the measurement observation time for the "push-update"
        notification in a "periodical" and for the "push-change-update"
        notification in a "on-change" subscription. By comparing the
        "observation-time" of two "push-update" notifications in a periodical
        subscription, the collector can deduce the actual cadence of the
        measurements, and compare it with the subscription configuration. In
        case of an "on-change" subscription it describes the time when the
        network state change was observed.</dd>

        <dt>point-in-time:</dt>

        <dd>Describes at which point in time the observation-time was
        observed. For "periodical" subscription this is either
        "accounting-start" or "accounting-end" describing the start or end of
        the accounting. For "on-change" subsriptions with or without sync on
        start option it is "state-changed" when the state change was observed
        in real-time. For "on-change" subsriptions with sync on start option
        it is "current-state" when it was observed after the YANG-Push
        subscription was established and the time since the state changed to
        current state is unkown.</dd>
      </dl>

      <t><xref target="timeline_examplen_fig"/> provides an example timeline
      of events to describe "point-in-time". At "T2", if the network node was
      capable to store the initial state change observation timestamp from
      "T1" prior to the YANG-Push subscription establishment at "T2", the
      observation-timestamp of "T1" is used and "point-in-time" is set to
      "state-changed". If the network node is not capable to store the
      timestamp prior to the YANG-Push subscription establishment at "T2", the
      observation-timestamp of "T2" is used and "point-in-time" is set to
      "current-state". Depending of capability and implementation of
      "periodical" YANG-Push subscription, either the "observation-timestamp"
      of "T3" with "point-in-time" is set to "accounting-start" or
      "observation-timestamp" of "T4" with "point-in-time" is set to
      "accounting-end".</t>
