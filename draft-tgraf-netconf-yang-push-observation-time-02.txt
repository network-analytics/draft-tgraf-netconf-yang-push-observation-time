1.  Introduction

   To correlate network data among different Network Telemetry planes as
   described in Section 3.1 of [RFC9232] or among different YANG-Push
   subscription types defined in Section 3.1 of [RFC8641], network
   "observation-time" describes with a timestamp when the state change
   was observed or when the data was accounted.  This is essential for
   understanding the timely relationship among these different planes
   and YANG push subscription types.

   With [I-D.tgraf-netconf-notif-sequencing] the delay between the YANG
   Notification export and the arrival at the downstream system storing
   the data can be measured.  With network "observation-time" described
   in this document, the delay between the time of the network
   observation and the data export of the YANG push publisher process
   can be measured as well, extending the delay measurement scope from
   the time the network observation and storing the data.

Internet-Draft     YANG Notifications Observation Time         June 2024


   When the time bucket length in a time series database and the
   periodical YANG push subscription time is identical, the eventTime of
   the netconf notification message header is used for indexing, there
   is variable delay between the "observation-time" and the "eventTime",
   and the "anchor-time" as described in Section 4.2 of [RFC8641] is
   close to the time bucket boundaries, a time bucket is going to have
   periodically 0 or 2 measurements indexed instead of 1.  Leading to
   inconsistent accounting errors in the time series database.  This
   problem is resolved by using the observation timestamp instead of the
   "eventTime" for time series database indexing.

   By extending YANG-Push Notifications with the "observation-time" YANG
   object timestamp and a "point-in-time" YANG enumeration for streaming
   update YANG-Push notifications it is ensured that the network
   "observation-time" timestamp is always present with the best
   available time, can be therefore used unconditionally in the data
   processing chain and with the "point-in-time" enumeration there is
   semantic describing at which point in time the "observation-time" was
   observed.

2.  Terminologies

   The following terms are defined in [RFC8639] and are not redefined
   here:

   Publisher

   Receiver

   Subscription

   In addition, this document defines the following terms:

   Observation-time: Describes when the metric(s) (reported in YANG-Push
   subscriptions) were observed for a given Subscription ID and
   notification message.

   Point-in-time: Describes at which point in time the metric(s)
   reported in YANG-Push subscriptions) were observed for a given
   Subscription ID and notification message.

3.  Extend the Streaming Update Notifications

   Besides the Subscription ID as described in Section 3.7 of [RFC8641],
   the following network observation time metadata objects are part of
   "push-update" and "push-change-update" notifications.

   timestamp:  States the measurement observation time for the "push-

      update" notification in a "periodical" and for the "push-change-
      update" notification in a "on-change" subscription.

      By comparing the observation timestamp of two "push-update"
      notifications in a periodical subscription, the collector can
      deduce the actual cadence of the measurements, and compare it with
      the subscription configuration.  In case of an "on-change"
      subscription it states the time when the network state change was
      observed.

   point-in-time:  The enumeration states at which point in time the
      value of the observation time was observed.  Choices are:

      current-accounting states for "periodical" subscriptions, the
      point-in-time where the metrics are being polled and observed

      state-changed states for "on-change" and "on-change sync on start"
      subscriptions, the point in time when the state change wa observed
      in real-time.

      current-state states for "on-change sync on start" subscriptions,
      the point in time when the state was observed after the
      subscription was established.  The actual time when the state
      changed to current is unkown.

   Figure 1 provides an example timeline of events to describe
   "observation-time" and "point-in-time" for "on-change sync on start"
   subscriptions.  At "T2", if the network node was capable of storing
   the initial state change timestamp used for "observation-time" from
   "T1" prior to the subscription establishment, the timestamp of "T1"
   is used for "observation-time" and "point-in-time" is set to "state-
   changed".  If the network node is not capable of storing the
   timestamp prior to the subscription establishment at "T2", the
   timestamp of "T2" is used in "observation-time" and "point-in-time"
   is set to "current-state".  At "T3" and "T4" the timestamp of "T3"
   respectively "T4" is used in "observation-time" and "point-in-time"
   is set to "state-changed".

4.  YANG-Push capabilities

   YANG-related system capabilities can be discovered by subscribing to
   the datastore defined in [RFC9196].  This document augments the
   "ietf-notification-capabilities" defined in Section 5 of [RFC9196] so
   that the YANG-Push receiver can learn the capabilities defined in
   this documents through the datastore.

   The definition of this YANG augmentation is specified in Section 5.

5.  The "ietf-yp-observation" YANG Module

   This YANG module augments the "ietf-yang-push" module with the
   observation timestamp and point-in-time in the "push-update" and
   "push-change-update" streaming update notifications.

5.1.1.  Tree View

   This "ietf-yp-observation" YANG module augments the "ietf-yang-push"
   YANG module specified in Section 5 of [RFC8641] adding the
   "timestamp" and the "point-in-time" leaves and augments "ietf-
   notification-capabilities" defined in [RFC9196] to add a system level
   capability.

6.  Implementation Status

   Note to the RFC-Editor: Please remove this section before publishing.

6.1.  6WIND VSR

   6WIND implemented this document for a YANG Push publisher on
   UDP-based Transport for Configured Subscriptions
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-udp-notif] in their VSR platform.

7.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations for the YANG notifications subscription
   mechanism are described in [RFC8641].  This document adds no
   additional security considerations.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document describes the URI used for the IETF XML Registry and
   registers a new YANG module name.

8.1.  URI

   IANA is requested to add this document as a reference in the
   following URI in the IETF XML Registry [RFC3688].

   URI:  urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-yp-observation

   Registrant Contact:  The IESG.

   XML:  N/A; the requested URI is an XML namespace.

   Reference:  RFC5277; RFC-to-be

8.2.  YANG module name

   This document registers the following YANG module in the YANG Module
   Names Registry [RFC6020], within the "YANG Parameters" registry:

   name:  ietf-yp-observation

   namespace:  urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-yp-observation

   prefix:  ypot

   Reference:  RFC-to-be
