    <abstract>
      <t>This document extends YANG-Push Notifications with the YANG objects
      "observation-time" timestamp and "point-in-time" enumeration for
      streaming update YANG-Push notifications.</t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

  <middle>
    <section anchor="Introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>To correlate network data among different Network Telemetry planes as
      described in Section 3.1 of <xref target="RFC9232"/> or among different
      YANG-Push subscription types defined in Section 3.1 of <xref
      target="RFC8641"/>, network "observation-time" describes with a
      timestamp when the state change was observed or when the data was
      accounted. This is essential for understanding the timely relationship
      among these different planes and YANG push subscription types.</t>

      <t>With <xref target="I-D.tgraf-netconf-notif-sequencing"/> the delay
      between the YANG Notification export and the arrival at the downstream
      system storing the data can be measured. With network "observation-time"
      described in this document, the delay between the time of the network
      observation and the data export of the YANG push publisher process can
      be measured as well, extending the delay measurement scope from the time
      the network observation and storing the data.</t>

      <t>When the time bucket length in a time series database and the
      periodical YANG push subscription time is identical, the eventTime of
      the netconf notification message header is used for indexing, there is
      variable delay between the "observation-time" and the "eventTime", and
      the "anchor-time" as described in Section 4.2 of <xref
      target="RFC8641"/> is close to the time bucket boundaries, a time bucket
      is going to have periodically 0 or 2 measurements indexed instead of 1.
      Leading to inconsistent accounting errors in the time series database.
      This problem is resolved by using the observation timestamp instead of
      the "eventTime" for time series database indexing.</t>

      <t>By extending YANG-Push Notifications with the "observation-time" YANG
      object timestamp and a "point-in-time" enumeration for streaming update
      YANG-Push notifications it is ensured that the network
      "observation-time" timestamp is always present with the best available
      time, can be therefore used unconditionally in the data processing chain
      and with the "point-in-time" enumeration there is semantic describing at
      which point in time the "observation-time" was observed.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Terminologies">
      <t>The following terms are defined in <xref target="RFC8639"/> and are
      not redefined here:</t>

      <t>Publisher</t>

      <t>Receiver</t>

      <t>Subscription</t>

      <t>In addition, this document defines the following terms:</t>

      <t>Observation-time: Describes when the metric(s) (reported in YANG-Push
      subscriptions) were observed for a given Subscription ID and
      notification message.</t>

      <t>Point-in-time: Describes at which point in time the metric(s)
      reported in YANG-Push subscriptions) were observed for a given
      Subscription ID and notification message.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Streaming-Update"
             title="Extend the Streaming Update Notifications">
      <t>Besides the Subscription ID as described in Section 3.7 of <xref
      target="RFC8641"/>, the following network observation time metadata
      objects are part of "push-update" and "push-change-update"
      notifications.</t>

      <dl>
        <dt>timestamp:</dt>

        <dd>
          <t>States the measurement observation time for the "push-update"
          notification in a "periodical" and for the "push-change-update"
          notification in a "on-change" subscription.</t>

          <t>By comparing the observation timestamp of two "push-update"
          notifications in a periodical subscription, the collector can deduce
          the actual cadence of the measurements, and compare it with the
          subscription configuration. In case of an "on-change" subscription
          it states the time when the network state change was observed.</t>
        </dd>

        <dt>point-in-time:</dt>

        <dd>
          <t>The enumeration states at which point in time the value of the
          observation time was observed. Choices are:</t>

          <t>current-accounting states for "periodical" subscriptions, the
          point-in-time where the metrics are being polled and observed</t>

          <t>state-changed states for "on-change" and "on-change sync on
          start" subscriptions, the point in time when the state change wa
          observed in real-time.</t>

          <t>current-state states for "on-change sync on start" subscriptions,
          the point in time when the state was observed after the subscription
          was established. The actual time when the state changed to current
          is unkown.</t>
        </dd>
      </dl>

      <t><xref target="timeline_examplen_on-change_fig"/> provides an example
      timeline of events to describe "observation-time" and "point-in-time"
      for "on-change sync on start" subscriptions. At "T2", if the network
      node was capable of storing the initial state change timestamp used for
      "observation-time" from "T1" prior to the subscription establishment,
      the timestamp of "T1" is used for "observation-time" and "point-in-time"
      is set to "state-changed". If the network node is not capable of storing
      the timestamp prior to the subscription establishment at "T2", the
      timestamp of "T2" is used in "observation-time" and "point-in-time" is
      set to "current-state". At "T3" and "T4" the timestamp of "T3"
      respectively "T4" is used in "observation-time" and "point-in-time" is
      set to "state-changed".</t>

      establishment as exampled in timeline with "T1" and "T2" in <xref
      target="timeline_examplen_on-change_fig"/> for "on-change sync on start"
      subscriptions could be very long when the network node uptime and thus
      the state change was long time ago and the subscription is establish
      very recent, a time series database may discard the notification message
      at ingestion since the "observation-time" timestamp is in the very past
      and therefore would have potential performance impact on the time series
      database indexing. This can be circumvent by using the eventTime for
      indexing or a change to "on-change" subscriptions instead.</t>
