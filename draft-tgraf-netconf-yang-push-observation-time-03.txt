1.  Introduction

   To correlate network data among different Network Telemetry planes as
   described in Section 3.1 of [RFC9232] or among different YANG-Push
   subscription types defined in Section 3.1 of [RFC8641], observation
   timestamp describes when the state change was observed or when the
   data was accounted.  This is essential for understanding the timely
   relationship among these different planes and YANG push subscription
   types.

   With [I-D.tgraf-netconf-notif-sequencing] the delay between the YANG
   Notification export and the arrival at the downstream system storing
   the data can be measured.  With observation timestamp described in
   this document, the delay between the time of the network observation
   and the data export of the YANG push publisher process can be
   measured as well, extending the delay measurement scope from the time
   the network observation and storing the data.

   When the time bucket length in a time series database and the
   periodical YANG push subscription time is identical, the eventTime of
   the netconf notification message header is used for indexing, there
   is variable delay between the observation timestamp and the
   eventTime, and the anchor-time as described in Section 4.2 of
   [RFC8641] is close to the time bucket boundaries, a time bucket is
   going to have periodically 0 or 2 measurements indexed instead of 1.

   Leading to inconsistent accounting errors in the time series
   database.  This problem is resolved by using the observation
   timestamp instead of the eventTime for time series database indexing.

   By extending YANG-Push Notifications with the observation timestamp
   YANG object and a point-in-time enumeration for streaming update
   YANG-Push notifications it is ensured that the observation timestamp
   is always present with the best available time, it can be therefore
   used unconditionally in the data processing chain and with the point-
   in-time enumeration there is semantic describing at which point in
   time the observation timestamp was observed.

2.  Terminologies

   The following terms are defined in [RFC8639] and are not redefined
   here:

   Publisher

   Receiver

   Subscription

   In addition, this document defines the following terms:

   Timestamp: Describes when the metric(s) (reported in YANG-Push
   subscriptions) were observed for a given Subscription ID and
   notification message.

   Point-in-time: Describes at which point in time the metric(s)
   reported in YANG-Push subscriptions) were observed for a given
   Subscription ID and notification message.

3.  Extend the Streaming Update Notifications

   Besides the Subscription ID as described in Section 3.7 of [RFC8641],
   the following network observation time metadata objects are part of
   "push-update" and "push-change-update" notifications.

   timestamp:  States the measurement observation time for the "push-
      update" notification in a "periodical" and for the "push-change-
      update" notification in a "on-change" subscription.

      By comparing the observation timestamp of two "push-update"
      notifications in a periodical subscription, the collector can
      deduce the actual cadence of the measurements, and compare it with
      the subscription configuration.  In case of an "on-change"
      subscription it states the time when the network state change was
      observed.

   point-in-time:  The enumeration states at which point in time the
      value of the observation timestamp was observed.  Choices are:

      current-accounting states for "periodical" subscriptions, the
      point-in-time where the metrics are being polled and observed.

      initial-state states for "on-change sync on start" subscriptions,
      the initial point in time when the subscription was established
      and the state was observed.

      state-changed states for "on-change" and "on-change sync on start"
      subscriptions, the point in time when the state change was
      observed after the subscription was established.

   Figure 1 provides an example timeline of events to describe
   observation timestamp and point-in-time for "on-change sync on start"
   subscriptions.  At "T2" when the "on-change sync on start"
   subscription is established, the timestamp of "T2" is used in
   observation timestamp and "point-in-time" is set to "initial-state".
   At "T3" and "T4" the timestamp of "T3" respectively "T4" is used in
   observation timestamp and point-in-time is set to "state-changed".

4.  YANG-Push capabilities

   YANG-related system capabilities can be discovered by subscribing to
   the datastore defined in [RFC9196].  This document augments the
   "ietf-notification-capabilities" defined in Section 5 of [RFC9196] so
   that the YANG-Push receiver can learn the capabilities defined in
   this documents through the datastore.

   The definition of this YANG augmentation is specified in Section 5.

5.  The "ietf-yp-observation" YANG Module

   This YANG module augments the "ietf-yang-push" module with the
   observation timestamp and point-in-time in the "push-update" and
   "push-change-update" streaming update notifications.

5.1.  Data Model Overview

5.1.1.  Tree View

   This "ietf-yp-observation" YANG module augments the "ietf-yang-push"
   YANG module specified in Section 5 of [RFC8641] adding the
   "timestamp" and the "point-in-time" leaves and augments "ietf-
   notification-capabilities" defined in [RFC9196] to add a system level
   capability.

6.  Implementation Status

   Note to the RFC-Editor: Please remove this section before publishing.

6.1.  Huawei VRP

   Huawei implemented in push-update and push-change-update
   notifications the timestamp and point-in-time extension as described
   in Section 3 for a YANG-Push publisher on UDP-based Transport for
   Configured Subscriptions [I-D.ietf-netconf-udp-notif] in their VRP
   platform.

6.2.  6WIND VSR

   6WIND implemented in push-update and push-change-update notifications
   the timestamp and point-in-time extension as described in Section 3
   for a YANG-Push publisher on UDP-based Transport for Configured
   Subscriptions [I-D.ietf-netconf-udp-notif] in their VSR platform.

6.3.  Cisco IOS XR

   Cisco implemented in push-update and push-change-update notifications
   the timestamp and point-in-time extension as described in Section 3
   for a YANG-Push publisher on UDP-based Transport for Configured
   Subscriptions [I-D.ietf-netconf-udp-notif] in their IOS XR platform.

7.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations for the YANG notifications subscription
   mechanism are described in [RFC8641].  This document adds no
   additional security considerations.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document describes the URI used for the IETF XML Registry and
   registers a new YANG module name.

8.1.  URI

   IANA is requested to add this document as a reference in the
   following URI in the IETF XML Registry [RFC3688].

   URI:  urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-yp-observation

   Registrant Contact:  The IESG.

   XML:  N/A; the requested URI is an XML namespace.
