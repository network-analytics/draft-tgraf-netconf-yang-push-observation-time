   Support of Network Observation Timestamping in YANG Notifications
               draft-tgraf-yang-push-observation-time-00

Abstract

   This document extends the YANG Notification header to support besides
   message export also network observation timestamping.  In case of
   "push-change-update" notifications to describe when the network state
   change was observed.  In case of "push-update" from when to when
   measurements where accounted.

1.  Introduction

   To correlate network data among different Network Telemetry planes as
   described in Section 3.1 of [RFC9232] or among different YANG push
   subscription types defined in Section 3.1 of [RFC8641], network
   observation timestamping describing when the state change was
   observed or from when to when the data was accounted is essential to
   understand the timely relationship among these different planes and
   YANG push subscription types.

   With <xref target="I-D.tgraf-netconf-notif-sequencing"/> the delay
   between the YANG Notification export and the arrival at the
   downstream system storing the data can be measured.  With network
   observation timestamping described in this document, the delay
   between the network observation and the data export of the YANG push
   publisher process can be measured as well, extending the delay
   measurement scope from the time the network observation and storing
   the data.

2.  Extend the Streaming Update Notifications

   Besides the Subscription ID as described in Section 3.7 of [RFC8641],
   the following network observation time metadata object is part of a
   "push-update" or "push-change-update" notification.  Depending on
   subscription type described in Section 3.1 of [RFC8641], the semantic
   meaning of the populated timestamp is different.

   observation-time:  Describes in case of a "periodical" subscription
      when the accounting has started.  By comparing the observation-
      time of two YANG Notifications, the time from when to when the
      measurements where accounted can be deducted.  In case of a "on-
      change" subscription it describes the time when the network state
      change was observed after the subscription was initially
      established.  In case of an "on-change sync on start" subscription
      it describes the time when the network state change was observed
      before the subscription was established.

   Figure 1 provides an example of a JSON encoded, [RFC8259], "push-
   change-update" notification message over HTTPS-based
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-https-notif] or UDP-based
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-udp-notif] transport for the same subscription.

3.  The "ietf-yang-push-revision" Module

3.1.  Data Model Overview

   This YANG module augments the "ietf-yang-push" module with the
   observation-time in the "push-update" and "push-change-update"
   streaming update notifications.

3.1.1.  Tree View

   The following is the YANG tree diagram [RFC8340] for the ietf-yang-
   push-netobs-timestamping YANG module

   module: ietf-yang-push-revision

3.1.2.  Full Tree View

   The following is the YANG tree diagram [RFC8340] for the ietf-yang-
   push-netobs-timestamping augmentation within the ietf-subscribed-
   notifications, including the RPCs and notifications.

   module: ietf-yang-push-netobs-timestamping

3.2.  YANG Module

   The YANG module has one leave augmenting the model of Subscription to
   YANG Notifications [RFC8639].

   <CODE BEGINS>
     file "ietf-yang-push-netobs-timestamping@2023-02-05.yang"
   module ietf-yang-push-netobs-timestamping {
   )
   <CODE ENDS>

4.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations for the YANG notifications subscription
   mechanism are described in [RFC8641].  This document adds no
   additional security considerations.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.

6.  Acknowledgements

   The authors would like to thank xxx for their review and valuable
